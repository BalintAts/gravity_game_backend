# Gravity Game Backend

## This is the backend of an online video game I am currently working on: [Gravity Game frontend](https://github.com/BalintAts/gravity_game/tree/dev)

The goal is to move the spaceship in real time to collect the yellow orbs by gravitating to the planets by pressing space. This can result in interesting trajectories and new kind of gameplay.

## Main features:
    - User register/login
    - Save/Load progress, corresponding to the user
    - Progress Ladder (displaying other user's progress in order)
    - Realtime movement, physics

## Technologies:
    - Springboot
    - Spring security
    - H2 database,   later I will use PostgrSQL
    - React for frontend.
